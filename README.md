Xo is a 2d pixel game where your goal is to kill the snakes that are trying to kill you and find out what's the secret behind them. Find secret rooms and progress through 15 levels.

This is the open sourced code for Delta Interactive's game, Xo. It has been developed by me and I used the Gdevelop game engine to make it.
